# Supabase Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Supabase for your cosmetic services marketplace application.

## 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Enter project details:
   - Name: `cosmologo` (or your preferred name)
   - Database Password: Choose a strong password
   - Region: Choose the closest region to your users
5. Click "Create new project"

## 2. Get Your API Keys

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings â†’ API
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ`)
   - **service_role** key (starts with `eyJ`)

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.

## 4. Create Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire SQL script from the `database_schema.sql` file (or the SQL provided in the conversation)
3. Click "Run" to execute the script

This will create all the necessary tables:
- `users` - Stores both regular users and providers
- `services` - Stores service offerings
- `provider_profiles` - Additional provider information
- `carts` - Shopping carts for users
- `cart_items` - Items in shopping carts
- `service_requests` - Service requests from users to providers

## 5. Set Up Row Level Security (RLS)

The SQL script includes RLS policies that:
- Allow users to view their own data
- Allow providers to view requests for their services
- Allow public viewing of services and provider profiles
- Restrict data access based on user authentication

## 6. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your application
3. Try to register a new user or provider
4. Test the login functionality
5. Verify that data is being stored in Supabase

## 7. Database Schema Overview

### Users Table
- Stores both regular users and service providers
- Uses `user_type` field to distinguish between 'user' and 'provider'
- Includes authentication information

### Services Table
- Stores all service offerings
- Linked to providers via `provider_id`
- Includes pricing and category information

### Provider Profiles Table
- Additional information for service providers
- Includes specialty and rating information

### Carts & Cart Items
- Shopping cart functionality for users
- Allows users to add services before making requests

### Service Requests Table
- Tracks service requests from users to providers
- Includes status tracking (pending, accepted, declined, completed)
- Supports scheduling and notes

## 8. Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase authentication with:
- Email/password registration for both users and providers
- Session management
- Row Level Security for data protection

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Make sure your `.env.local` file is in the project root
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and API keys are correct
   - Check that your database is online in the Supabase dashboard

3. **RLS policy errors**
   - Ensure you're logged in when accessing protected data
   - Check that the user has the correct permissions

4. **Type errors**
   - The TypeScript types are defined in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Make sure all database operations match the expected types

## 10. Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update your environment variables with production Supabase credentials
2. Ensure your Supabase project is in the correct region for your users
3. Set up proper CORS settings in your Supabase dashboard
4. Consider setting up database backups
5. Monitor your application logs for any issues

## 11. Security Considerations

- Never expose your `service_role` key in client-side code
- Use RLS policies to protect sensitive data
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your Supabase usage and set up alerts

## 12. Next Steps

After setting up Supabase:

1. Add more features like real-time notifications
2. Implement file uploads for service images
3. Add payment processing integration
4. Set up email notifications
5. Add analytics and monitoring
